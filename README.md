# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Python/Pandas/Jupyter - School district analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
### Background
I am assisting Maria, the superintendant of PyCitySchool district in analysis on passing percentages among different schools in the district across different factors.
Once the original analysis was complete, it was decided to retract all Thomas High School 9th grade - grades with Nan as the data does not seem reliable to use and make decisions on.
With that being said, all THS 9th grades were replaced with Nan and the rest of the data remains as is.

### Resources
Python and Panda
this analysis was perfomed in Jupyter notebooks

### Objectives
1. Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
2. Repeat the school district analysis
3. Analyze 7 different School metrics : Top 5 Performing Schools, Bottom 5 Performing Schools, Average Math Scores, Average Reading Scores, Scores by School Spending, Scores bu School Size, Scores by School Type
4. Analyze the changes in the outcomes/key metrics between the two disctrict analysis files and effects of roming Thomas High School 9th graders
